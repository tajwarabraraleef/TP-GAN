### Dependencies
```
Python 3.6
Tensorflow: 2.0.0
Keras: 2.3.1
```

### Environment Setup

Recreate conda environment as follows:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Or if you are using Docker:
```
docker pull tazleef/tf2.0.0-cv-keras2.3.1-imgaug:latest
```

### Training

Due to privacy policy, we are unable to share our clinical dataset. However, we have included a few sample cases for reference. Format your centre's dataset in the same way and set the filepath and training parameters in `train.py`. 

To train the model, run `train.py`. 

This code can be used for other 3D image to image translation task by modifying the network architectures accordingly.
